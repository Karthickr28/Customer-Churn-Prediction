📊 Customer Churn Prediction – AlphaCom Telecom
🏢 Business Context

AlphaCom, a leading telecom provider, is experiencing a significant increase in customer churn despite offering competitive services and a diverse product portfolio. Rising churn is directly affecting revenue, customer lifetime value, and brand reputation in a highly competitive market.

Traditional retention efforts have fallen short because churn is influenced by multiple interconnected factors such as service usage, billing preferences, contract duration, and demographics. Without clear data-driven insights, the company is forced to react to churn instead of preventing it—resulting in higher acquisition costs and reduced customer satisfaction.

🎯 Objective

As a Data Scientist at AlphaCom, your task is to build a predictive machine learning model that:

Identifies customers at high risk of churn

Uncovers the key factors influencing their decisions

Enables the business to design targeted retention strategies

Reduces churn-related revenue losses

Improves customer lifetime value and strengthens AlphaCom’s competitive position

The final solution aims to help the company move from reactive to proactive churn management.
